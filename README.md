## World-Class Computing Experience

![Laptop](https://os.gnome.org/assets/laptop.png)

We build products that create one cohesive vision and experience:

- **Shell**: desktop environment for PC and mobile operating systems. Designed based on user testing and research with input from industry stakeholders to be intuitive and efficient.

   Shell provides everything you could need from the "system" UI of an operating system: window management, workspaces, app launching, notifications, clock and calendar, quick settings, permissions prompts, system-wide search, and more.

- **Core apps**: apps we consider part of the core computing experience including a file manager, image viewer, text editor, web browser, settings, and many more.

   [See All Core Apps](https://apps.gnome.org/#core)

**Get GNOME**: GNOME is used as the default experience across Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, Vanila OS, Endless OS, and more. 

   GNOME is available for most other Linux distributions such as Arch Linux.

   We also provide a [reference OS](https://os.gnome.org) for testing and development.

## Growing Ecosystem

![Apps](https://apps.gnome.org/assets/overview-illustration/boring.svg)

GNOME works with the larger free and open source community on shared technologies, interoperability, specifications, best practices, and standards.

- **[GNOME Circle](https://circle.gnome.org)**: community-developed apps that follow GNOME best practices and guidelines for a cohesive experience

- **[Flathub](https://flathub.org)**: the app store for Linux where you can find most GNOME Core apps, GNOME Circle apps, and thousands of third-party apps you can use with GNOME

- **[FreeDesktop](https://www.freedesktop.org)**: software and specifications for free and open source desktops

## Exceptional Community

Above all, GNOME is people. A diverse community of largely-volunteer contributors from around the world make up the GNOME project.

We're not one monolithic entity—we may not always agree on everything!—but we work together to build what we believe is the best experience and direction for computing.

Contributors to GNOME can apply for [GNOME Foundation Membership](https://foundation.gnome.org/membership/) which comes with voting rights, the ability to run for election to the Board of Directors, and other privileges.
