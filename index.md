## World-class computing

We build products that create one cohesive vision and experience.

### Desktop

We develop GNOME Shell, a desktop environment for PC operating systems. Designed based on user testing and research with input from industry stakeholders to be intuitive and efficient.

![Activities](https://www.gnome.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GNOME45-workspace-1024x660.webp)

GNOME Shell provides everything you could need from the "system" UI of an operating system: window management, workspaces, app launching, notifications, clock and calendar, quick settings, permissions prompts, system-wide search, and more.

### Core Apps

Suite of apps that make up the core experience including a file manager, video player, image viewer, text editor, web browser, settings, and many more.

GNOME apps are designed to be simple and consistent so once you've used one, each feels familiar and intuitive.

### Get GNOME

GNOME is used as the default experience across [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux), [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/desktop), [Debian](https://www.debian.org/), [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/), [Vanilla OS](https://vanillaos.org/), [Endless OS](https://endlessos.org/os), and more.

GNOME is available for most other Linux distributions, such as [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) and [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org).

We also provide a reference [GNOME OS] for testing and development.

## Part of a growing ecosystem

We work with the larger free and open source community on shared technologies, interoperability, specifications, best practices, and standards.

![Apps](https://apps.gnome.org/assets/overview-illustration/boring.svg){: .half }

- **[GNOME Circle](https://circle.gnome.org)**: community-developed apps that follow GNOME best practices and guidelines for a cohesive experience

- **[Flathub](https://flathub.org)**: the app store for Linux where you can find most GNOME Core apps, GNOME Circle apps, and thousands of third-party apps you can use with GNOME

- **[FreeDesktop](https://www.freedesktop.org)**: software and specifications for free and open source desktops

## Exceptional community

Above all, GNOME is people. A diverse community of largely-volunteer contributors from around the world make up the GNOME project.

We're not one monolithic entity—we may not always agree on everything!—but we work together to build what we believe is the best experience and direction for computing.

Contributors to GNOME can apply for [GNOME Foundation Membership](https://foundation.gnome.org/membership/) which comes with voting rights, the ability to run for election to the Board of Directors, and other privileges.
