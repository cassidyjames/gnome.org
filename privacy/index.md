# GNOME ♥ Privacy

We believe everyone deserves privacy, and we respect that right. GNOME products actively protect your privacy to help keep your private data private to you and your device—chiefly by not collecting it in the first place.

[Read Privacy Policy](./full){: .learn-more }

## Features & Techniques

We build privacy-respecting security features and use privacy-preserving approaches across the entire GNOME desktop.

### Sandboxing

We use sandboxing technologies like [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) and [Portals](https://flatpak.github.io/xdg-desktop-portal/) which keep you in control of what apps can access. Our apps request and use as few permissions as possible, and we highlight the safety and permissions of every app in GNOME Software.

### Privacy Indication

GNOME Shell reveals when apps are known to be accessing your webcam, listening to your microphone, viewing your screen, or running in the background with highly visible, on-screen indicators in the top bar.

### Permissions

Control per-app permissions including which apps are allowed to process and return search results, send notifications, run in the background, use location services, and view your camera—all built into Settings.

### Automatic Deletion

Trashed and temporary files on your device can expose sensitive information to prying eyes. GNOME helps you choose whether and how often to automatically delete this data.

### Device Security

The Settings app exposes your hardware's level of protection from security threats, based on the [Host Security ID](https://fwupd.github.io/libfwupdplugin/hsi.html) specification. Device Security also flags known security events so you can be as informed as possible.

### Local-first

Apps and features run locally on your device, only using the network when required for a specific feature you're actively using. Your documents, settings, and personal data are never uploaded or shared with anyone without you actively taking action to do so.

### Verified Apps

GNOME Software shows when a developer has verified the ownership of their app, helping you trust it is what it says it is.

### Non-profit

We’re supported by the independent non-profit [GNOME Foundation](https://foundation.gnome.org). Our goal is to create a computing platform for use by the general public that is completely free software; we're not driven by a profit motive.

### Open Source

Everything we develop is open source, developed in the open. Our code is widely used by large distributors and regularly reviewed for security. Everyone from a curious individual to a professional security researcher is able to audit our work.
